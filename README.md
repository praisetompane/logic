## Objectives
- An attempt at distilling to layman's terms:
  - Logic.
  - Logic's Foundations and Invention | Discovery.
  - Logic's Relationship with [Computation](https://github.com/praisetompane/computation) and [Mathematics](https://github.com/praisetompane/mathematics).

## Definitions
- def logic(Ben-David, 2015): the study of how to reliably get from assumptions to conclusions.

#### Formal Classification Scheme
  - [Semi-formal Classification scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_logic#Branches_of_logic)

#### Foundations
  - Theoretical Basis: ???
  - [Formal Science](https://zbmath.org/classification/?q=cc%3A03B)
  - [Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/)

#### Invention | Discovery
  - ???

## Learning Order
- [0_formal_logic](0_formal_logic/0_formal_logic.txt)

## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Setup Instructions
- The repository is configured to use [devcontainers](https://containers.dev) for development. <br>It requires no setup except an editor that supports devcontainers, which will prompt you on first open to start it in a container.
    - [Supported Editors](https://containers.dev/supporting)
    - [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
