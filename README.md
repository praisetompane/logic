## Objectives
- An attempt at unpacking Logic and its relationship with Mathematics.

## Definitions
- def logic(Ben-David, 2015):
      - formal: ???
        - in words: ???

      - plain english: the study of correct reasoning.
      - intuition: how to reliably get from assumotioins to conclusions.

- Formal Classification Scheme: ???
  - Semi-formal Classification scheme
    - [Branches of Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_logic#Branches_of_logic)

- Theory
  - Theoretical Basis: Philosophy???

## Learning Order
- [0_formal_logic](formal_logic/0_formal_logic.txt)

## Dependencies
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Setup Instructions
- The repository is configured to use [devcontainers](https://containers.dev) for development. <br>It requires no setup except an editor that supports devcontainers, which will prompt you on first open to start it in a container.
