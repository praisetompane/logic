# What is Logic?

def propositional logic:
    TBD

def predicate logic or 
    first-order logic or
    first-order predicate logic: 
        a formal language
            with precise rules of formation. 
            just like computer programming languages(C, Java, etx) (Kunen, 2007:6) (Sakharov).          

    def proof : 
        def¹ (Kunen, 2007:6): a finite sequence of sentences
                                        written in this language
                                        that obey 
                                            a precisely defined rule of inference.
                                            rules of inference = {modus ponens, ...}
        
        def² (Montalban, 2020): an argument
                                    that uses
                                        logical steps
                                    to show
                                        that a mathematical statement
                                        follows from certain axioms.
    

    syntactic objects (Kunen, 2007:6):
        - predicate logic sentences
        - formal proofs

def second-order logic:
    TBD

def higher-order logic:
    TBD


def: the formal mathematical study of the 
                methods, structure and validity of 
                    mathematical deduction and proof (Weisstein).

investigates and classifies the structure of sentences
    using:
        - formal systems of inference
        - analysis/study of arguments in natural language (Wikipedia)
